**PATTERNS**
Look for patterns in the input.  Look for patterns in memory of past input and output.

**MAPS**
Connect memories and input and output together.

**FAIDING MEMORY**
How do I make a computer have an imperfect memory? Parts of data could be overwritten by new memories.


**Procedure**

Program will operate on characters input on the commandline.  It will break them up by character, by parts of word, by word, by sentence.  They will be mapped and searched for patterns and put in memory.

It needs a reason to output something.  What is the goal?

    Survival of each part of the memory is the goal.  They will get wiped out as the topic of conversation changes.  Good subjects and thoughts will survive.


Every input, output, and interaction updates the memory map.
